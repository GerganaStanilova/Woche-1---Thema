Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

Stem cells (SCs) are characterized by their ability to stay in an undifferentiated state for many cell cycles and to differentiate into
any number of mature cell types, depending on the stem cell. In general, there are two types of stem cells – the embryonic and the somatic SCs. 
The embryonic stem cells (ESC) are pluripotent and therefore can mature into a large number of cells, while on the other hand the somatic 
(also called adult) SCs are multipotent so they have a more limited palette of possibilities. In the last decade, a new method was developed, 
which enabled reverting already differentiated cells back into a stem-cell-like state. These reprogrammed so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
serve as an alternative to the ESCs and therefore manage to reduce the problem with the controversy surrounding them.
